# Final Project-CSC8503

This is the final project I did for the course *CSC8503: Advanced Game Technologies* as a part of the *Computer Game Engineering MSc* provided by Newcastle University.

It currently looks like [this](AboutTheProject.pdf).

<ins>NOTE</ins>: I am planning to seriously polish this project in the near future.
